Started to install Raspberry Pi OS on a Raspberry Pi Zero
Got into the OS with the set PW
Started to look into the setup of the DNS Sinkhole
This Pi won't work
Ordered a new one
Raspberry Pi 5 has everything I need
-8GB of RAM
-4 USB
-1GB Ethernet
-Bluetooth
-PCIe Expansion connector

Once I got the Raspberry Pi started, I imaged the OS onto the Pi. Set up the account and PW. Set up a Static IP for the Raspberry Pi. I tried to remote into the Raspberry Pi with SSH, and it did not work had to get Puddy to remote into the Raspberry Pi from my Windows PC. 
Set up, pie hole on the Raspberry Pi, got everything configured on the pie hole, and had about eight lists that I found online that people have made and keep up to date. Some of the list are malicious websites, tracking, blocking ads, Etc.
Once I got all that up and working, I had to set up my own modem and router to then get into the battery itself to change the DNS IP address to the Raspberry Pi so everything could go through the Raspberry Pi as the DNS server. Once I was able to do that, I was able to change the IP address and have everything point to the Raspberry Pi as the DNS server. 
After that, everything has worked perfectly fine, and it is doing its job fantastically.


The only downside is that some of my family members say it's working too well. AKA, it's blocking the apps on the free app they use on their iPads.
